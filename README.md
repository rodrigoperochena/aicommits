## Why this CLI?
- **Lightweight:** ~**10.0 kB** unpacked on npm.
- **Zero-friction UX:** `aicommits` (no subcommand) runs the default **commit** flow.
- **Focused messages:** scope to the staged files you select.
- **Explain mode:** `aicommits explain` summarizes what changed.
- **One-time setup:** stores config at `~/.config/aicommits/config.json` (or `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/...`).

---

## Install
```bash
npm i -g @taksumaq/aicommits
```
> Requires Node.js 18+. Check with `node --version`.

---

## Configure
Save your API key (DeepSeek) to your user config:
```bash
aicommits config set DEEPSEEK_API_KEY=sk-your-key
```

---

## Usage
Stage changes, then run:
```bash
git add <files...>
aicommits
```
Short aliases also work: `aicommit`, `aicmt`, `aic`.

### Useful extras:
```bash
aicommits config path                  # see where the config lives

```
